## Purpose

A healtcare dessert is a region where individuals have poor access to care.  Sometimes, it's defined as a populated region more than 60 minutes from an acute care hospital.  Realistically, every individual has their own level of difficulty reaching different types of care that they may need based on their living situation, their insurance, their personal transportation, and other factors.  Our goal is to use a combination a data sources, together with time-to-destination estimates from Google Maps to vizualize how dificult it is for Americans to reach a care center they need, and understand the correllates of this distance-to-care.
