1. Big Problem: Health Care Accessibility
2. Key Subproblem: Physical distance as a barrier to health care access
3. Unsolved: No systematic modeling
4. Solution: Combine Google Maps with Census/Publically available health care data
5. Team/Opportunity: We have technical expertise, Google Maps API is available
6. Aims: (1) Vizualization (2) Correllation (3) Modeling
7. State of world: We will provide a reusable pipeline to model this key and under-studied barrier to healthcare access.
